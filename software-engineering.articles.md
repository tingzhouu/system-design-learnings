**Key Quote:** "When youâ€™re starting something new, the most important thing is knowing what to learn." Figure that out, spend 15-20 hours going hard, and you can learn most anything in record time."

**Summary:**

- I ask myself: What is my mental model when it comes to learning and how has it changed over the years? Has it ever updated before?
- I realise that I'm trying to learn too many things concurrently and that is not helping. I should focus on them sequentially instead.

### [How Software Groups Rot: Legacy of the Expert Beginner](https://daedtech.com/how-software-groups-rot-legacy-of-the-expert-beginner/)

**Status:** âœ… Read

**Key Quote:** "But what happens when the Advanced Beginner doesnâ€™t care enough to interact with the broader community and for whatever reason doesnâ€™t have much interaction with peers? They fail even while convinced that the failure is everyone elseâ€™s fault, and the nature of the game is such that blaming others is easy and handy to relieve any cognitive dissonance. They come to the conclusion that theyâ€™ve quickly reached Expert status and thereâ€™s nowhere left to go."

**Summary:** (after reading)

- It's not difficult to fall into the trap of an Expert Beginner and stagnate. It takes a lot of reflection, self-awareness and putting yourself in an environment of growth which is sometimes painful. And we as human tend to avoid pain.
